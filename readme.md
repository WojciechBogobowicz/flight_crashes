# Motivation

One day, stupid question about polish famous flight crash come to my mind. When I tried to answer it I visited [wikipedia page](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katastrofy_i_incydenty_cywilnych_samolot%C3%B3w_pasa%C5%BCerskich), which contains lot of information about flight crashes, but it has unstructured and hard to analyze data, so instead of finding betted source of information, I decided to clean this one, and check what can get from it.


# About project

This small demo is about flight crashes analysis.  
The demo consist of three components
- Data scrapping from polish wikipedia page.
- Data cleaning
- Data visualization 
   
Be aware that page I used isn't the most valuable source of data. During my analysis I fond some missing data that are present on other sites (for example on english wiki), as well as data errors, so you shouldn't learn about flight crashes from it.  
Whats more data is in polish language, so it may be a little bit hard to analyze for not polish speakers.
